# Malfunctions #

The ship has experienced its fair share of crews and their eventual expiration. Even though it's stood for long, it's got some scratches of its own and they're showing more and more as the days go on.

This mod adds random malfunctions to the ship and intends to improve the core game loop with interesting new metagame events.

## Events ##

### Route Table Offset / Navigation Malfunction ###

This malfunction appears after the ship goes back into orbit. It overwrites all routing commands and steers the ship to a random moon at no cost. No information about the moon or the weather is given to the players forcing them to possibly go on a tough expedition.

A warning is given after the ship enters orbit. The terminal routing will be blocked until the ship leaves the rerouted planet.

### Atomic Misalignment / Teleporter Malfunction ###

This malfunction causes teleporters to become temporarily unavailable during an expedition. It has a high chance of happening moments after landing but can also happen over the course of an expedition at a random moment.

A warning after landing is given. Ship teleporters are either disabled immediately or after a random interval.

### Core Surge / Power Malfunction ###

This malfunction causes the ship to lose power to all its primary systems. This means batteries can not be recharged, doors can't be closed, the map can't be used, players can't be teleported and the terminal remains disabled. This is the worst type of malfunction.

To add onto that, no warning is given with this malfunction. The only solution to restore power is to use the remainder to launch back into orbit.

## Bugs / Todo ##

- Make a distinctively different notification in style with the radiation pop-up
