# Malfunctions #

The ship has experienced its fair share of crews and their eventual expiration. Even though it's stood for long, it's got some scratches of its own and they're showing more and more as the days go on.

This mod adds random malfunctions to the ship and intends to improve the core game loop with interesting new metagame events.

## Events ##

### Route Table Offset / Navigation Malfunction ###

This malfunction appears after the ship goes back into orbit. It overwrites all routing commands and steers the ship to a random moon at no cost. No information about the moon or the weather is given to the players forcing them to possibly go on a tough expedition.

A warning is given after the ship enters orbit.

### (Planned) Atomic Misalignment / Teleporter Malfunction ###

This malfunction causes teleporters to become temporarily unavailable during an expedition. It has a high chance of happening moments after landing but can also happen over the course of an expedition at a random moment.

A warning during landing is given and once this happens the teleporters will emit sparks.

## Bugs / Todo ##

- Routing to a moon after the navigation malfunctions is currently still possible
- Make a distinctively different notification in style with the radiation pop-up
